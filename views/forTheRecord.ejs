            <h2>Artist Payout Transparency</h2>
            <p>We’re committed to fair artist compensation. In 2024, over <strong>$12 million</strong> was paid out to musicians using CloyMusic. Our platform uses a direct-to-artist model, where fan plays contribute more directly to artist earnings.</p>
